# Drone-swarm
This is a repository where id be sharing my work in this project. \
We have decided to make a custom flight controller therefore we need to build our own firmware which is a very difficult task because the community has very less content about swarming and custom FC's.  \
The source files and header files have been written by me and my team to initiate and read values from the sensors connected to the STM32 based FC. \
The drone_algorithm is a very primitive one which in fact is not the actual algorithm but it was a part of my application when i had applied for this team.
